1.what is JSX?
ans: JSX is html like syntax .but it's not HTML in inside javascript .
     it is used to create react elements and react components.
     (JSX is a JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together.)
     You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.
     ex :const jsx = <h1>This is JSX</h1>

2.superpowers of JSX?
ans : --> readability
      --> syntatical suguar 
      -->less code
      -->Re-usebility
      --> maintainability  
      --> JSX helps for code simpler and Attractive when writing large pieces of code for big React Application
      -->compound composition: using one component in other component.
      --> XSS attack (cross site script attack )not possible as reactdom escapes and sanetize the code that passed to react component.


3.Roll of type attribute in script tag? what options can i use there?
ans:type Attribute is used to specify the MIME (A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type))
     type of script and identify the content of the Tag. 
     It has a Default value which is “text/javascript”.

module - This value specfiy that code must be treated as javascript module and the processing of the script content is deffered.
	in module script we can use import and export, to import funtion from another file and export to another file.

4.{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent> </TitleComponent>}
ans:   {TitleComponent} will treat as javascript in JSX. if it is component , it will give error on DOM.
       we can write componet in {TitleComponent()} this is will treat as normal jSX.

       {<TitleComponent/>} is a function component and return a JSX that will render on dom.
